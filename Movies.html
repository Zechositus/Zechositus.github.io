                <dd>Just a stunning film. One of the most beautiful I've ever seen right next to Blade Runner 
                    2049. Based on a source material that makes a good adaption to the screen next to impossible,
                    Denis Villeneuve's vision soared above all of my expectations (I'm looking at you 1984 Dune).

                <dd>Bo Burnham managed to take a collective feeling we all experienced during the pandemic and wrapped
                     it into an hour and a half long cinematographic masterpiece.

                <dd>Matt Damon and Robin Williams' killer performance will live rent free in my head for years to come.

                <dd>I love everything about this movie. A family comes together to support each other in unexpected ways 
                    is the cherry on top of life. </dd><br>

                <dd> know this is an unpopular opinion but I watch this on Christmas every year and I'm entertained every

                <dd>Another movie for Christmas time, although more traditional. Makes me feel nostalgic and warm inside.</dd><br>

                    <dd>Inception revolutionized quite a bit. The original score has been copied 12 ways to Sunday with varying 
                        degrees of success. It's another visually striking film with a fun plot and edge of your seat action with 
                        an ambiguous ending.</dd><br> 
            <dt><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11291274/" target = "_blank"><strong>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022)</strong></a></dt>
                <dd> Easily one of the best dramadies I've ever seen. Nicolas Cage and Pedro Pascal are truly a dynamic comedy duo. 
                    I don't think this movie would have worked with a different cast.  </dd><br>
