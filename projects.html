                <dd>The idea is really simple. If Zener diode in reverse bias works by tunneling through a potential
                    barrier, then is it possible to calculate the dimensions based on the IV characteristics? I am
                    working to find out.</dd><br>

                <dd>Easily the bane of my existance but a fun challenge. I have been a musician for nearly 14 years.
                    Guitar is my main instrument and I want to build my pedals isntead of buying them. I have a raspberry
                    Pi 0 that I use to make a simple looping logic that will carry me throught my musical journey.</dd><br>

                <dd>Whoa, your kinda seeing my progress right now. Feel free to open your browsers console and see what I have
                    done and added. You can also check out my page about<a href ="">Pedals</a>to see a sample.</dd>
